The application uses a packaged version of the UI Components library. If you would like to modify this library and use it in this application, checkout the master branch (ee2d9da68486d478a01249f2f73a18e10c242e3c) of this library and switch your index.unpackaged.html with your index.html.
To package again your changes, you need to commit them to a fork of the UI Components library under your own github account. Checkout the newly created repo on a local environment, run the following Gruntfile.js on the root directory of the UIComponents to build a package (you might need to edit your Gruntfile to include the new widget modules you are using).
